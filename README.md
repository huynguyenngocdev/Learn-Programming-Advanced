# Learn Programming Advanced

- I created it to save what I learn when programming
- I read and reference from many sources and will try to put its source here.
- If you see anything wrong or something I wasn't allowed to save in my repo here, please get in touch with me by email: <huynguyenngoc.dev@gmail.com>
